# ByteConf-Demo-Repo

First demo of graqphql from ByteConf on GraphQL (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPQ-eBM9-BY)

Uses Github's [GrahpiQL editor](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/) to queries a user's connections as well as create a mutation that itstelf creates a repository (this repository, in fact!)
